# SMILES-RL-Transformer
Experimentation with transformer-based actor models and transfer learning 
Transfer learning using teacher-student learning with tunable hybrid loss function (soft target and label loss). 

Transformer model performed as well, if not better, than RNN model at lower actor learning rates. Performance may improve with greater batch size and training steps. 

**Must be run within original SMILES-RL env***
